              <p style="font-size: 25px !important;">Every situation in life is temporary. so when life is good dont think of what will happen next just enjoy the moment. 
                and when life is bad just remember that it will not last forever and better day are on the way💖. Time heals everything.
                Your smile is so beautiful that it could light up the world and give hope to the hopeless. I find myself looking up jokes or remembering funny things during the day just so that I can see you smile.💖😁❣ Keep smiling, re.
                just a simple smile can make ur day so much better i promise that. <br><br>

                you are one of the nicest person i have ever met shreeshu 🧡🤗💖, and i want to thank u for always staying by my side through thick and thin
                u have always been nice to ppl and helpful and kind and forgiving and plz dont ever change that for anyone always remain the same charming and 
                a positive person who spreads positivity 💖. And i want to tell u this one important thing plz do love urself as much as u love the ppl around you,
                and plz be nice to yourself and dont forget to make urself happy in the processes of making others happy.🤗💕💖 <br><br>

                in this world you spend time with a lot of people. people come and go but only one person is always there with u 24x7 and that person is you 
                and you need to take care of ppl who are always with you 💕💖 , so you please take care of urself the most , stop putting others needs before yours 
                i dont say that u have to be selfish but being too selfless is also not good so always make urself happy 
                and if ur happiness affect others happiness then its fine cuz only u have to take care of urself these other ppl wont be there always to make u happy 
                and please stop doubting, questoning and overthinking. these are not gonna solve any problem it will only increase the problem .
                and being sad is also of no help think of this scenario, now something happened and u feel sad and u feel like crying , is being sad and sitting and worryig 
                about it going to help u in any way ?? noooo , instead try to do something about it and if its in ur controll. if its not in ur controll then there is no 
                use worrying about it cuz u cant do anything about it. instead try to focus on good thoughts and try not to do it in the future avlo than 🧡💛.

                and last but not the least talk to ur loved onse about whats bothering you , if its super personal talk to mom , and if u need a friends shoulder to cry on
                im always there, just talk to me about it or any other friend whome u trust💖. just put a smile akka and everything will fall in place eventually
                stay happy always 💞😊🤗💖.
